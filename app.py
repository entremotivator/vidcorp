# Introduction Section
st.header("Introduction")
st.write("""
The **Curaçao Department of Labor** plays a crucial role in strengthening the island's workforce by empowering its population with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in a competitive, ever-evolving global economy. The importance of a well-trained workforce cannot be overstated, particularly in sectors that are vital to the island’s economic success, such as **tourism**, **hospitality**, and **cleaning services**. 

In light of this, **VIDeMI Services BV**, based in Willemstad, is proud to present this comprehensive proposal aimed at significantly improving the workforce's skill set. Through a targeted training initiative focused on three essential areas—**hospitality**, **cleaning**, and **mindset development**—this program seeks to enhance the employability of youth and adults, reduce unemployment, and increase professionalism across key sectors. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to support the island's economic growth, with a particular focus on expanding and improving the **tourism** sector, which remains the cornerstone of Curaçao's economic development.

We believe this program will bridge existing skills gaps, increase workplace readiness, and contribute to Curaçao’s long-term economic sustainability by fostering a more skilled, efficient, and motivated workforce.

# Background Section
st.header("Background")
st.write("""
Curaçao's economy relies heavily on **tourism** and the **service sectors**, with **hospitality** and **cleaning services** forming the backbone of the island’s attractiveness to tourists. However, despite the growing demand for skilled workers in these areas, there remains a significant skills gap in the workforce. Many young people and adults seeking employment in these industries lack the formal training and industry-recognized certifications needed to meet international standards. This mismatch between industry demand and labor supply results in **underemployment**, a mismatch of skills, and ultimately, missed economic opportunities for both businesses and workers.

Additionally, with an increasingly globalized economy and the rise of digital tools in service sectors, workers in hospitality, tourism, and cleaning need more than just technical skills. Soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence are now just as important. This gap in mindset and professional development is another area where targeted training can make a lasting impact, not just in employability, but in workforce morale and retention.

Through this proposal, VIDeMI Services BV seeks to provide the necessary training that will help workers excel in these sectors while aligning with Curaçao's strategic goals for economic development and sustainable growth.
